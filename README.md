# Module Challenge #4

## Description
For this fourth challenge, we had to create a code quiz challenge using JavaScript. We had to build the code from scratch, utilizing what we had learned up to that point. After creating a fairly basic HTML and CSS file, I worked extensively on the JavaScript file and tested the coding along the way to ensure that everything worked. I used the provided mock-up as a reference and fact-checked the questions to make sure they were correct. I created a variable to store the questions, four possible answers, and the correct answer. I also created functionality that shows either "Wrong!" or "Correct!" based on the answer chosen. From the start screen, the user can either start the quiz or View the High Scores. When the user clicks the "Star Quiz" button, the screen changes to the question screen and the timer starts going down from 100. If the user picks the right answer, they get a point and an extra 10 seconds on the timer, but if they answer wrong, they don't get any points and lose 10 seconds off the timer. The quiz ends either when all the questions have been answered or when the timer runs out. Once it ends, the user can enter their initials and be added to the high scores. I decided to go the extra mile and sort the high scores from highest to lowest.
